# CSV Download Fix - Progress Tracking

## Issue
The CSV downloadable was empty with just column names instead of containing the actual meeting log data.

## Root Cause
1. The download URL in Controls.tsx was hardcoded to `http://localhost:5000/download-logs-excel`, which only works when the frontend runs on the same machine and not on port 5000.
2. Direct link navigation was being blocked by browser security policies.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the download functionality in `intellimeet/src/components/Controls.tsx`:

1. **Dynamic URL generation**: Use `$config.FRONTEND_ENDPOINT` or `window.location.origin` as base URL
2. **Fetch-based download**: Use `fetch()` API to retrieve CSV data instead of direct link navigation
3. **Blob URL creation**: Create a blob URL from the response for secure downloading
4. **Error handling**: Added proper error handling with user-friendly toast notifications

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated `intellimeet/src/components/Controls.tsx` download logic
- [x] Made URL generation dynamic instead of hardcoded localhost
- [x] Implemented fetch-based download with blob URLs
- [x] Added error handling and user feedback
- [x] Updated `server.js` CORS configuration for better compatibility
- [x] Improved error messages to be more specific about network issues
- [x] Added `LOG_SERVER_ENDPOINT` configuration for flexible deployment
- [x] Updated both `config.json` and `defaultConfig.js` with log server endpoint

## Testing Status
- No testing performed yet
- Need to verify the CSV download works with actual log data
- Need to test error scenarios (server not running, network issues)

## Follow-up
- Test the fix in the actual application
- Verify CORS headers on the log server if needed
- Monitor for any remaining network or security issues
